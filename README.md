# BerserkScrapper
An easy home made scrapper for the berserk manga from berserkonline.com. I do not own any of the rights from the web or the manga, it's just some code pasted in order to get the images and make a pdf per chapter

INSTRUCTIONS:

-> Python is needed for the code to execute
-> Make sure you got every library used in this project installed (BeautifulSoup, request, urllib, PILLOW,..)

USAGE:
-> python3 berserkScrapper <path_to_save_manga_images>
  -->This is going to make a folder for every chapter in the manga and put the correspondent images in each folder
-> python3 imageToPdf <...chapter_folder> 
  --> ex: python3 imageToPdf C://Users/x/Documents/Berserk_manga/berserk-chapter-1/ C://Users/x/Documents/Berserk_manga/berserk-chapter-2 ....
  
you can modify it for any of your needs, I do not own this, its just that I wanted to read the manga in my mobile in pdf
