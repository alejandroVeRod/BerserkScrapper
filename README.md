# BerserkScrapper
An easy home made scrapper for the berserk manga from berserkonline.com. I do not own any of the rights from the web or the manga, it's just a tool to get the manga in pdf to read it on my phone :P

WINDOWS
--------
Just execute the .exe file then a black window will appear asking for you to put the chapter number you want to read
(from 1 to 364 the latest one), then because the chapter names in berserk are weird it will ask you to select
the one you want, put again the number then wait for the download to finish and the pdf will be in the same path
as the .exe file is!

DEVELOPER
---------
-> Python and pip is needed for the code to execute
-> >pip install -r requirements.txt
-> >python BerserkScrapper.py 

Feel free to change any of the code to your needs, this is only a tool i wanted to create for everyone :P
